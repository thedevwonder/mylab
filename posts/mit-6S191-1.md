title: MIT Intro to Deep Learning - Lab 1
---

I started watching the lecture series of MIT Intro to Deep Learning. This short course has been on my list of courses that would give me an idea and intuition on writing deep learning models for some future projects.

I have been really excited about completing the course and have been religiously trying to complete the assignments and labwork included with the course.

I will create a git repo to record and track my assignments that will include Jupyter notebooks. I am posting the link to the first lab assignment. Let's get started!!
